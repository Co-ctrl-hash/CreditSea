## 🚀 NEXT STEPS - Start Here!

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (IMPORTANT!)

Open **TWO** terminal windows:

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\BADAL ORAON\OneDrive\Desktop\Harshdeep\backend"
npm install
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\BADAL ORAON\OneDrive\Desktop\Harshdeep\frontend"
npm install
```

Wait for both to complete (2-3 minutes).

---

### Step 2: Start MongoDB

Check if MongoDB is installed:

```powershell
mongod --version
```

Start MongoDB:

```powershell
net start MongoDB
```

Or download MongoDB from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

---

### Step 3: Run the Application

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\BADAL ORAON\OneDrive\Desktop\Harshdeep\backend"
npm run dev
```

Expected output:

```
🚀 Server is running on port 5000
✅ MongoDB Connected: localhost
📊 Database: creditsea
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\BADAL ORAON\OneDrive\Desktop\Harshdeep\frontend"
npm run dev
```

Expected output:

```
VITE ready in XXX ms
➜ Local: http://localhost:3000
```

---

### Step 4: Test Everything

1. **Open browser:** http://localhost:3000

   - You should see the CreditSea welcome page

2. **Test backend API:** http://localhost:5000

   - You should see JSON with API info

3. **Check MongoDB:**
   - Download MongoDB Compass: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass
   - Connect to: `mongodb://localhost:27017`
   - Look for `creditsea` database

5. ✅ **Read through all the documentation files**
6. ✅ **Explore the code** - understand what each file does

### Tonight (Study Time - 1 hour):

1. **Express.js Basics** (20 mins)

   - Watch: "Express JS Crash Course" on YouTube
   - Focus on: routing, middleware, req/res objects

2. **React Basics** (20 mins)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Test Frequently**

Don't write too much code without testing. Test after every small feature.

### 2. **Use Console Logs**

```javascript
console.log("📍 Debug point:", variable);
```

### 3. **Read Error Messages**

Errors are your friends! They tell you exactly what's wrong.

### 4. **Commit Often**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add meaningful message"
```

### 5. **Take Breaks**

Follow the Pomodoro Technique: 25 mins work, 5 mins break.

### 6. **Ask Questions**

When stuck, search:

- "how to [what you want] in express"
- "react [component name] example"
- Stack Overflow is your friend!

## 🎓 Learning Approach

### Don't:

❌ Copy-paste without understanding
❌ Try to learn everything at once
❌ Skip error messages
❌ Work for hours without breaks
❌ Be afraid to make mistakes

### Do:

✅ Read and understand each line
✅ Learn one concept at a time
✅ Debug systematically
✅ Take regular breaks
✅ Experiment and break things

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Quick Guide

### Backend won't start:

```powershell
# Check if port is in use
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# Kill the process
taskkill /PID <number> /F

# Try again
npm run dev
```

### Frontend won't start:

```powershell
# Clear node modules
rm -r node_modules
rm package-lock.json

# Reinstall
npm install

# Try again
npm run dev
```

### MongoDB won't connect:

```powershell
# Check if running
net start MongoDB

# Or start manually
mongod

# Check with Compass
# Connect to: mongodb://localhost:27017
```

### Git issues:

```powershell
# Check status
git status

# Undo last commit (if needed)
git reset HEAD~1

# See commit history
git log --oneline
```
